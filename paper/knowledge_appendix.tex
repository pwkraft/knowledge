\section{Data Overview}\label{app:variables}

\subsection{Open-Ended Items}

\paragraph{2018 Cooperative Election Study (CES):}
The main analysis focuses on a national stratified survey of 1,000 respondents as part of the 2018 CES. Among other items, the study includes the following open-ended questions:
\begin{itemize}
	\item On the issue of \textbf{gun legislation}, please outline the main arguments that come to mind \textit{in favor and against} background checks for all gun sales, including at gun shows and over the Internet.
	\item On the issue of \textbf{abortion}, please outline the main arguments that come to mind \textit{in favor and against} banning abortions after the 20th week of pregnancy.
	\item On the issue of \textbf{immigration}, please outline the main arguments that come to mind \textit{in favor and against} providing a legal status for recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) status.
	\item On the issue of \textbf{health cure}, please outline the main arguments that come to mind \textit{in favor and against} repealing the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare).
	\item On the issue of \textbf{trade policies}, please outline the main arguments that come to mind \textit{in favor and against} imposing tariffs on imported steel and aluminum from countries including Canada, Europe, and Mexico.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{2020, 2016, \& 2012 American National Election Study (ANES):}
In addition to the original data collection as part of the CES, I apply the measurement approach using three separate waves of the American National Election Study (ANES), each of which consists of a representative survey of about 5000 adults in the months before the US Presidential election in each year. Here, discursive sophistication is evaluated using a set of 8 open-ended questions in which respondents were asked to list anything in particular that they like/dislike about the Democratic/Republican party as well as anything that might make them vote/not vote for either of the Presidential candidates.

\paragraph{2015 YouGov Survey}
In order to replicate and extend the main analysis, I rely on a separate nationally representative survey employing yet another alternative set of open-ended responses. The data was collected by YouGov in December 2015 and contains responses of 1000 U.S. residents. %\footnote{See \citet{clifford2018disgust} for details on the study.} 
As part of this study, respondents were asked to describe their attitudes towards two prominent political issues that were discussed frequently in the media. First, they were asked in a closed format whether they favor or oppose stricter gun laws. Subsequently, they were asked to respond to the following two questions:
\begin{itemize}\setlength\itemsep{0em}
	\item Still thinking about the question you just answered, what thoughts came to mind while you were answering that question? Please try to list everything that came to mind.
	\item Thinking about the mass shootings that have occurred in the U.S. in the last few years, what factors do you think are responsible for the shootings?
\end{itemize}
Second, the respondents reported on their attitudes towards the Affordable Care Act in a closed format and were then asked to elaborate in their own words by answering the following questions:
\begin{itemize}\setlength\itemsep{0em}
	\item Still thinking about the question you just answered, what thoughts came to mind while you were answering that question? Please try to list everything that came to mind.
	\item For decades, experts have observed that the United States spends far more per person on health care than any other country. However, the U.S. falls behind on most measures of health care outcomes, such as life expectancy. What factors do you think are responsible for the state of our health care system?
\end{itemize}
%Here, discursive sophistication is evaluated based on the verbatim responses to the four preceding questions using the same procedures described above. 
%Similar to the CES study, the questions directly address considerations related to specific policy issues that were prominent in the political discourse at the time of the survey.

\paragraph{Swiss Referendum Survey}
Lastly, I examine survey data on Swiss citizens justifying their vote choices on multiple referenda used in a recent analysis by \citet{colombo2016justifications}. The author compiled a data set of cross-sectional surveys administered in Switzerland after national popular votes on multiple policy propositions. The original surveys were conducted as representative samples after each of thirty-four national policy votes that were held between 2008 and 2012 resulting in a total of about 27,000 observations. Respondents who participated in a given referendum (ca. 22,000 in total) were asked to describe the main reason as well as additional justifications for their decision in two separate items. 
%As before, discursive sophistication is evaluated based on verbatim responses to both questions. Since the Swiss survey was conducted in three different languages (German, French, and Italian), I computed the measure of discursive sophistication separately for each group of respondents.

\subsection{Preprocessing and Topic Model Specification}

I rely on the structural topic model framework to extract and differentiate considerations mentioned by respondents. I follow the guidelines in \citet{roberts2014structural} to preprocess our open-ended responses (lowercasing and stemming as well as removing stopwords, punctuation, numbers, and infrequent terms)\footnote{Prior to applying these preprocessing steps, responses are cleaned by removing open-ended item non-response such as `don't know' and correcting spelling errors using an implementation of the Aspell spell-checking algorithm (\url{www.aspell.net}).} and used age, gender, education, party identification, as well as an interaction between education and party identification as covariates for topic prevalence. With the exception of gender, this variable selection is equivalent to the procedure described in \citet{roberts2014structural} for open-ended survey responses such as those included in the ANES. I set the number of topics to 25 in order to focus on the differentiation of broader considerations, but we replicate equivalent results with larger numbers of topics below. Figure~\ref{fig:stm_prop} displays the resulting topic proportions for all data sets included in the analyses along with the most frequent and exclusive (FREX) terms associated with each topic.

\section{Robustness Checks}\label{app:robustness}

\subsection{PreText Analysis}\label{app:topicmodel}

The first component of discursive sophistication (\textit{size}) relies on quantities extracted from structural topic models \citep{roberts2014structural}. As with any other text-as-data approach, a necessary first step before estimating the topic model is to preprocess the raw text and convert it into a document term matrix \citep[DTM, see for example][]{manning2008introduction}. Common preprocessing procedures include stemming and lowercasing, as well as the removal of numbers, punctuation, stopwords, and infrequent terms. However, topic models and other unsupervised learning techniques can be sensitive to these preprocessing choices. To address this issue, \citet{denny2018text} recommend that researchers compare DTMs under all possible preprocessing regimes. The authors propose \textit{preText scores} as a measure to quantify the extent to which varying preprocessing regimes may yield unusual results compared to a baseline without any preprocessing. Following the procedure outlined in \citet{denny2018text}, Figure~\ref{fig:pretext} displays the results of a linear model regressing preText scores resulting from all possible preprocessing regimes on each individual step for a subset of 500 open-ended responses in each of the surveys included in the analyses. Significant coefficients indicate that the topic model results may be sensitive to the respective preprocessing step.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering\includegraphics[scale=.9]{../fig/pretext.png}
    \caption[PreText analysis of preprocessing decisions of open-ended responses across all datasets]{PreText analysis of preprocessing decisions of open-ended responses across all datasets. Regression coefficients display the effects of each of the six preprocessing choices on the resulting preText score.}\label{fig:pretext}
\end{figure}


\clearpage
\subsection{Discursive Sophistication for Varying Model Specifications}

According to the analysis in Figure~\ref{fig:pretext}, our results may be particularly sensitive to stemming and the removal of stopwords or punctuation. \citet{denny2018text}, however, emphasize that the most important consideration in choosing preprocessing steps are theoretical. Given that the purpose of our topic model is to extract considerations related to political preferences, there are no theoretical reasons to incorporate punctuation since it does not contain any relevant content. It is less obvious from a theoretical perspective whether to use stemming or to remove stopwords from our open-ended responses, although it might be preferable in order to increase computational efficiency. Following \citet{denny2018text}, I proceed by assessing to what extent discursive sophistication varies across the alternative preprocessing regimes identified as potentially influential. In addition, I consider another crucial modeling choice when working with topic models: determining the total number of topics $k$ to be estimated.

Figure~\ref{fig:pretext_robustness} examines whether the proposed measure of discursive sophistication is sensitive to changing the number of topics $k$, stemming, and the removal of stopwords. The y-axis depicts the preferred preprocessing regime including all steps discussed above while the x-axis plots discursive sophistication resulting from alternative specifications. The panels on the left compare the preferred specification to discursive sophistication based on a larger number of topics ($k=35$). The center panels does not use stemming as part of the preprocessing. The panels on the right do not remove stopwords prior to estimating the topic model. Across all data sets, discursive sophistication scores are highly correlated and therefore insensitive to preprocessing choices. Thus, the substantive results discussed in the main text are robust for alternative preprocessing regimes or varying numbers of topics.

Model estimates are based on logistic regression (turnout) or OLS (political interest, internal efficacy, external efficacy). Compared to the specification used in Figure~\ref{fig:knoweff} (controlling for gender, education, income, age, race, and church attendance), the models displayed here include additional controls for personality (extraversion, openness to experience, being reserved), survey mode (online vs. offline), verbal skills (Wordsum score), and overall verbosity (response length).% Full model results are presented in the appendix, Tables \ref{tab:knoweff2012_personality} and \ref{tab:knoweff2016_personality}.
