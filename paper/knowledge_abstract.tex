This paper proposes a simple but powerful framework to measure political sophistication based on open-ended survey responses. \textit{Discursive sophistication} utilizes quantitative text analysis methods to capture the complexity of individual attitude expression. I validate the approach by comparing it to conventional political knowledge metrics in multiple studies using different batteries of open-ended items. The paper proceeds to illustrate how the measure can help refine previous insights from the literature such as the oft-cited gender gap in political knowledge.
