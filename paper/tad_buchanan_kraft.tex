There is a broad consensus among scholars of political science and public opinion that the American electorate is not well informed about politics. However, there is no agreement in the discipline about \textit{how to measure} how little citizens actually know. While many studies rely on simple factual political knowledge questions to assess political sophistication, others have criticized this approach from methodological and theoretical perspectives, claiming it does not provide a valid measure of the concept of interest. We propose a new measure of political sophistication based on open-ended survey responses about individual political attitudes and preferences. Using conventional political knowledge metrics and open-ended responses from the 2012 American National Election Study (ANES), we consider word count, topic diversity, opinion diversity, and a novel aggregate measure to show that ...

\section{Introduction}

On of the fundamental concepts in the study of political attitudes and behavior is political sophistication and knowledge \citep{converse1964nature,carpini1996americans}. While most scholars emphasize how little people know about politics, the question of how to assess individual knowledge has been subject to re-occurring scholarly debate \citep[e.g.][]{mondak2000reconsidering,mondak2001asked,sturgis2008experiment,debell2013harder,pietryka2013analysis}. Many analyses exclusively rely on individual levels of political knowledge measured by correctness of factual knowledge questions. However, recent research points to important differences between types of knowledge questions that have previously been disregarded \citep{barabas2014question}, such as distinguishing between policy-specific and general knowledge questions. Furthermore, scholars argue that factual political knowledge as measured in many surveys may not be theoretically relevant \citep[e.g., the question writer and respondent have differing world-views]{lupia2006elitism}. Rather, the conceptualization of political sophistication should take into account how people structure their attitudes and beliefs \citep[e.g.][]{luskin1987measuring}. As such, measuring sophistication solely based on answers to political trivia may misclassify respondents who cannot recall these facts, but do indeed have a coherent cognitive framework of political ideas.

We propose an alternative measure of political sophistication based on an individual's responses to open-ended questions about their attitudes towards major parties and presidential candidates. We make inferences about the respondents' level of political sophistication and belief constraints by focusing on \textit{how} respondents describe their preferences and beliefs. More specifically, we consider the diversity in topics raised by respondents. Topic diversity will be measured using structural topic models \citep{roberts2014structural}. Furthermore, we consider additional characteristics of individual open-ended responses, such as response length and diversity between opinions. Our aim is to assess the degree to which political attitudes are structured and expressed in a more complex manner than discernible form correctness on a factual questionnaire. We suspect that the diversity in topics a respondent discusses, or the detail with which they speak about the topics they mention, will covary with other political knowledge measures. We therefore compare the text-based measures to common factual knowledge items as well as the interviewer assessment of the respondent's political knowledge as benchmarks for political sophistication. This text based analysis will likely be conceptually closer to the actual structure and constraint of political belief systems \citep[see for example][]{tetlock1983cognitive,luskin1987measuring} than fact based knowledge items can capture.

Overall, we hope to show that our measure of political sophistication can provide novel insights compared to conventional knowledge measures. Furthermore, developing valid measures of political sophistication based on open-ended responses will provide new opportunities for comparisons of political knowledge across time and contexts.


\section{Political Knowledge and Sophistication}
% 1: defining political participation in the literature
% 2: measuring political sophistication, previous approaches
% 3: issues with previous approaches, criticism

In his seminal study, \citet{converse1964nature} examined the degree to which citizens hold constrained belief systems about politics. In the paper, belief systems are defined as ``a configuration of ideas and attitudes in which the elements are bound together by some form of constraint or functional interdependence'' \citep[207]{converse1964nature}. The analyses showed that the majority of the electorate does not hold structured and constrained belief systems, understand abstract ideological concepts, or hold stable issue positions. 

This pessimistic view regarding the competence of the US electorate has been supported in multiple subsequent analyses. \citet{carpini1996americans} showed that large parts of the American electorate are not sufficiently informed about politics. Furthermore, there are systematic differences in political attitudes and behavior between citizens who are well informed compared to those who are not. Such a finding is problematic from a normative perspective, since it indicates that differences in levels of information can result in unequal representation in the political system \citep[see also][]{althaus1998information,kuklinski2000misinformation,gilens2001political}. However, rather than relying on the degree to which individuals hold constrained belief systems, \citet{carpini1996americans}, conceptualized knowledge as the awareness of key democratic values, which was measured using factual knowledge questions \citep[see also][]{carpini1993measuring}. A broad range of studies focused on similar factual knowledge measures as indicators of sophistication \citep[e.g.][]{zaller1991information,jacoby1995structure,gomez2001political}. Most prominently, \citet{zaller1992nature} argued for the measurement of political awareness using tests of neutral factual information about politics, since they ``more directly than any of the alternative measures, capture what has actually gotten into peopleâ€™s minds'' \citep[21]{zaller1992nature}. However, other research casts doubt on this assertion, both from methodological as well as theoretical perspectives.

Methodologically, many studies raised issues related to the validity of factual knowledge questions. One fundamental problem discussed in the literature are potential biases due to guessing \citep{mondak2000reconsidering,mondak2001developing,mondak2001asked,miller2008experimenting}. Knowledge items that offer a ``Don't Know'' option essentially convolute two very distinct concepts: the individual information level as well as the propensity to guess. Based on this argument, \citet{mondak2004knowledge} showed that conventional knowledge measures overestimated the gender gap in political knowledge due to the fact that male respondents are more likely to take a guess if they are not fully informed \citep[see also][for a more recent discussion of differential item functioning as an explanation for knowledge gaps]{pietryka2013analysis}. The conclusions drawn from these studies were to rely on closed rather than open-ended knowledge questions and omitting ``Don't Know'' response options \citep[but see][]{sturgis2008experiment,luskin2011don}. Other scholars further criticized open-ended factual knowledge questions such as those administered in the American National Election Study due to problematic coding rules, which do not accurately capture partial knowledge \citep{krosnick2008problems,gibson2009knowing,debell2013harder}.

Focusing exclusively on factual political knowledge has also been criticized on theoretical grounds. For example, \citet{lupia2006elitism} argued that the information asked for in the item batteries has no clear relevance for individual political participation. Instead, researchers should concentrate on knowledge and heuristics that directly help citizens to make competent political decisions \citep[see also][]{lupia1994shortcuts}. Responses to factual knowledge questions have further been shown to be conditional on the respondents' motivation, their partisanship, as well as monetary incentives in the survey \citep{prior2008money,bullock2015partisan,prior2015you}. Conventional items also differ with regard to the specific dimension of political knowledge they measure \citep{barabas2014question} and ignore important aspects such as visual cues \citep{prior2014visual}.

Overall, the studies discussed so far suggest that the conventional item batteries have problematic measurement properties. More importantly, however, some authors raised doubts whether factual political knowledge actually captures the phenomena that are ultimately most interesting for scholars of public opinion. \citet{converse1964nature} initially discussed the level of constraint in political beliefs rather than isolated pieces of factual information about the political system. Other scholars emphasized similar conceptualizations of political sophistication. \citet{tetlock1983cognitive}, for example, used the term \textit{integrative complexity} to describe the variety and integration of considerations related to an issue. It is important to note that here, sophistication is not based on the content (or accuracy) of related considerations but rather on its \textit{structure}. \citet{luskin1987measuring} also defined political sophistication based on the structure of individual belief systems. More specifically, the author argues that belief systems can vary on three separate dimensions: (1) their \textit{size} -- i.e. the number of cognitions, (2) their \textit{range} -- i.e. the dispersion of cognition over categories, and (3) their \textit{constraint} -- i.e. the extent to which cognitions are interconnected. Political sophistication, in turn, is seen as the conjunction of these dimensions: ``A person is politically sophisticated to the extent to which his or her [political belief system] is large, wide-ranging, and highly constrained.'' \citep[860]{luskin1987measuring}.

Such a conceptualization of political sophistication seems theoretically more interesting and useful than simple tests of factual information. However, why does such a large body of literature in political science and public opinion then only focus on knowledge questions? One answer to this question is provided in the early study by \citet[206]{converse1964nature}, who stated: ``what is important to study cannot be measured and that what can be measured is not important to study.'' Factual political knowledge is much easier to assess (albeit not perfectly) than the structure of political belief systems. Indeed, \citet{tetlock1983cognitive} had to rely on manual coding of policy statements of US senators in order to assess their degree of integrative complexity. Such manual coding procedures, however, become increasingly infeasible with large amounts of text data (such as in large surveys). Advances in automated text analyses, on the other hand, provide us with the necessary tools to derive a measure of political sophistication that captures the theoretical arguments put forward by \citet{converse1964nature}, \citet{tetlock1983cognitive} and \citet{luskin1987measuring}, without the necessity of human coders. In the following, we will derive and explore such a measure based on open-ended survey responses.


\section{Measurement Approach}
% 1: describe measure and how it relates to theoretical conceptualization of sophistication (see Luskin's definition)
% 2: how are open-ended responses administered, potential issues
% 3: conclusion: coding open-ended responses gets us closer to the definition of political sophistication that we are actually interested in!

We propose that the the dimensions laid out by \citet{luskin1987measuring} --- size, range, and constraint of political belief systems --- can be measured by directly examining how individuals describe their political attitudes and beliefs. More specifically, we will consider individual responses to a set of open-ended questions where respondents were asked to describe aspects that they liked and disliked about both major parties and presidential candidates before the 2012 US election. Considering likes and dislikes separately, there are a total number of 8 open-ended responses where individuals describe their beliefs and attitudes towards political actors. Table~\ref{tab:measure} summarizes how different characteristics of open-ended responses can be matched to the aspects of political sophistication discussed previously.

\begin{table}[h]
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\hline 
Dimension of political belief system & Characteristic of open-ended response \\
\hline
Size (number of cognitions) & Overall length of responses \\
Range (dispersion of cognitions over categories) & Diversity in topics raised in responses \\
Constraint (interconnectedness of cognitions) & Diversity in response length between items \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Aspects of political sophistication and its measure in open-ended responses.}\label{tab:measure}
\end{table}

The size of the political belief system can simply be captured as the overall length of individual responses. If people possess a larger number of considerations related to political parties and candidates, then this should be reflected in the  overall collection of their responses describing their attitudes and beliefs.

The range of cognitions over categories could be measured as the diversity in topics raised in individual responses. If individuals hold more diverse cognitions towards political actors, we should observe that they address a wider range of topics in their responses, rather than focusing on an isolated issue to describe their preferences.

The last dimension, the degree of constraint or interconnectedness of cognitions, is more difficult to capture in an automated way based on characteristics of an open-ended response. While we cannot directly measure the interconnectedness of cognitions, we argue that the diversity in response length between items could be used as a possible proxy. In order to see why this is the case, consider two hypothetical individuals who possess a belief system of similar size and range. Accordingly, we would expect that their open-ended responses should be of similar overall length and have a comparable degree of diversity in topics. Now, suppose that for one individual, the belief system is highly interconnected, and for the other individual it is not. Holding the overall length and topic diversity of their set of responses constant, higher interconnectedness allows individuals to spread their response topics more homogeneously across items. In other words, if considerations were not interconnected, then responding to likes as well as dislikes (for party/candidates of in/out-party), would require an increase in the overall length and diversity of the response. As such, distributing responses across different items indicates a higher diversity in opinions and can therefore be seen as a proxy for interconnectedness of cognitions.

Of course, the measurement strategy derived here makes strong implicit assumptions about the nature of political belief systems. However, the sole purpose of this short discussion was to suggest potential links between the theoretical construct and measurable characteristics of open-ended responses. Ultimately, it is an empirical question, as to whether these characteristics provide valid measures of political sophistication. Before we turn to the issue of validation, we will discuss the data and methods used in the analyses in more detail.



\section{Data and Methods}
% describe dataset and open-ended responses
% describe measure for each dimension as well as composite measure of sophistication

We use survey data from the 2012 American National Election Study in order to demonstrate and validate  our measure of political sophistication. The dataset consists of 5914 adults (2054 of which participated in face-to-face interviews while the remaining 3860 participated in a representative online survey). While both samples differ slightly with regards to the inclusion of some specific variables, we will mostly rely on the pooled dataset purpose of our analysis.

The sophistication measure is based on open-ended questions in which respondents were asked to list anything in particular that they like/dislike about the Democratic/Republican party as well as anything that might make them vote/not vote for either of the Presidential candidates and were probed by the interviewer asking ``anything else?'' until the respondent answered no. All open-ended responses were pre-processed by correcting spelling errors using an implementation of the Aspell spell checking algorithm in \texttt{R} (\url{www.aspell.net}), and deleting individuals who responded in Spanish (228 individuals). 

As discussed above, we consider three different aspects of the open-ended responses to capture the distinct dimensions of political sophistication discussed above: size, range, and constraint of the political belief system. The \textbf{size} of the belief system is measured as the word count for each individual over all prompts:
\begin{equation}
\text{size}_i = \log\left(\sum_{j=1}^J n_{ij}\right),
\end{equation}
where $n_{ij}$ is the number of words in the response of individual $i$ in response to question $j$. $J$ denotes the set of all likes/dislikes items. We use the log of the count linearize the distribution of responses. The \textbf{range} of the belief system is captured as the diversity in topics raised by each respondents. We conceptualize diversity as the Shannon-entropy of topic proportions \citep{shannon1948mathematical,munger2016elites}:\footnote{The structural topic model was estimated using the \texttt{stm} package in R \citep{roberts2014structural}. The number of topics was selected using the algorithm of \citet{lee2014low} and the model was estimated via spectral initialization to address the issue of multi-modality \citep[see][for details]{roberts2014stm}. We used measures for age, education, party identification, as well as an interaction between education and party identification as covariates for topic prevalence. This variable selection is equivalent to the procedure model specification described in \citet{roberts2014structural}. We estimated a total number of 72 topics. While we cannot discuss the topics in detail due to limited space, it is worth noting that the results reported hereafter are robust for model specifications with fewer numbers of topics.}
\begin{equation}
\text{range}_i = âˆ’\sum_{k=1}^K \theta_{ik} \log_2(\theta_{ik}),
\end{equation}
where $\theta_{ik}$ denotes the predicted proportion of topic $k$ in the collection of responses by individual $i$. The variable ranges from 0 (entire response focuses on single topic), to $\log_2(K=72)$ (every topic has the same proportion). As a proxy for \textbf{constraint}, we rely on the same logic and measure the diversity in opinions raised across item by computing the Shannon-entropy of the proportions of response lengths for each likes/dislikes question:
\begin{equation}
\text{constraint}_i = âˆ’\sum_{j=1}^J p_{ij} \log_2(p_{ij}),
\end{equation}
where $p_{ij}=\tfrac{n_{ij}}{\sum_{j=1}^J n_{ij}}$ is the proportion of words in the response of individual $i$ to question $j$ relative to the overall size of the individuals' response. Again, the variable ranges from 0 (only one question was answered) to $\log_2(J=8)$ (all questions were answered with the same word length per answer).

Together, the three measures form a composite metric of political sophistication. We decided to combine the measures in a multiplicative rather than an additive fashion, because sophistication can be seen as \textit{conjunctive} \citep[see][]{luskin1987measuring}. In other words, the separate elements are only effective in combination and are not simple substitutes of each other:
\begin{equation}
\text{sophistication}_i = (\text{size}_i + 1) * (\text{range}_i + 1) * (\text{constraint}_i + 1).
\end{equation}
Note that we added $+1$ to each term in order to assure that the minimum of each individual variable is 1 rather than 0. This way, we are still able to capture variation in sophistication if one of the elements is at its minimum.

We consider a number of conventional political knowledge measures for comparison with our metrics. The variables are summarized in Table~\ref{tab:featextr}. The first three measures are based on additive scales indicating the number of correct responses. The interviewer evaluation (only available in face-to-face sample) is based on a five-point scale that was recorded after the interviews (pre-election and post-election wave).

Furthermore, the analyses outlined below will include several control variables such as media exposure, frequency of political discussions, gender, age, race, religiosity, ideology, party identification, and interview mode (face-to-face vs. online).
	

\section{Descriptive Results}
% histogram of response length could be useful -> done
% histogram of individual aspects -> done
% show examples of high and low scoring political knowledge -> appendix
% distribution of knowledge measure -> done
% correlation plot with other knowledge measures (including individual aspects) -> done

As a first step, we will examine the characteristics of open-ended responses our measure of political sophistication is composed of. Figure~\ref{fig:wc} displays the word count as well as the logged word count of the collection of open-ended responses for each individual.

\begin{figure}[h]
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../fig/wc.pdf}
\caption{Distribution of Response Lengths}\label{fig:wc}
\end{figure}

The distribution of raw word count is highly skewed. Most respondents only provide very brief statements when they describe their attitudes towards political parties and candidates. The mean response length to all 8 questions is about 75 words, so an average response to a single question consisted of less than 10 words. (omitting respondents who did not provide any information)

Figure~\ref{fig:diversity} presents histograms of the remaining two diversity measures as well as the composite index of political sophistication. Diversity across topics (left panel) is skewed and overall relatively large. Only few respondents appeared to focus on a very selective number of topics. As we will further discuss below, this finding can be partly attributed to the way topic proportions are estimated in the structural topic model. The distribution of response diversity (or opinion/item diversity, see middle panel), on the other hand, indicates that a large proportion of respondents only answered on open-ended question, which leads to a response diversity of 0.
\begin{figure}[h]
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../fig/diversity_distributions.png}
\caption{Diversity Distributions and Sophistication Measure}\label{fig:diversity}
\end{figure}
Looking at the histogram on the right in Figure~\ref{fig:diversity}, we can see that the combined measure of sophistication is approximately normally distributed and captures a large amount of variance between individuals. In the following section we will examine whether this variance is conceptually meaningful.


\section{Validation Performance}
% replicate common findings, e.g. gender gap in political knowledge \citep[e.g.][]{barabas2014question}
% Increase in consistency b/w policy attitudes \citep[e.g.][]{prior2014visual}

As a first step, we want to compare our measure with conventional knowledge indices. Figure~\ref{fig:corr} displays a correlation matrix of the traditional measures as well as the individual open-ended response characteristics and the composite measure of sophistication.

\begin{figure}[h]
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../fig/corr_fixed_data.png}
\caption{Correlation Plot of Knowledge Measures}\label{fig:corr}
\end{figure}

The bold black box highlights the correlations between the political knowledge measures and the calculated diversity measures.  Our first observation is that political knowledge measures are modestly to strongly correlated with on another.  This finding is interesting; while if confirms that these measures do covary to some degree, they are not all capturing the same types of knowledge, as might be expected.  Next, we see that Topic Diversity has low negative correlation with all other measures.  This suggests that topic diversity alone, in this context, is not an appropriate measure of political knowledge.  A possible explanation for this finding is the fact that the posterior topic proportions of the structural topic model are not only determined by the words in each response but also the respective prior over topics. As such, if a respondent only mentions a single word in his or her response, the estimated topic proportions will be still be relatively equal (i.e. indicating high diversity), rather than strictly unitary. Therefore, short responses might overestimate topic diversity with our method, which explains the negative correlation with traditional knowledge measures. However, we will leave this issue for further extensions and note that any potential biases caused by this issue are (at least partly) compensated by including overall response lengths and opinion diversity in the resulting sophistication measure.

We also see the Response Diversity and the composite final diversity metric have stronger correlations with the political knowledge measures than log(Response Word Count), suggesting that these two diversity measures are not strictly due to the length of the open-ended responses.  Finally, we see that our final composite diversity score correlates across other political knowledge measures on the same order of magnitude as Factual Knowledge and Majorities in Congress, yet donâ€™t not have especially high correlation with either.  This is evidence that our composite diversity score is worthy of consideration among standard political knowledge measures, and captures independent information.    

The next step of out validation consists of comparing the results for common determinants of political knowledge across the conventional as well as our text-based measure of political sophistication. Previous studies consistently showed that political knowledge is positively affected by media exposure, frequent political discussions, and education. Furthermore, research has frequently found a gender gap, where female respondents appear to be less informed about politics \citep[c.f.][]{barabas2014question}.\footnote{However, as discussed previously, this gap can be partly attributed to differences in the propensity to guess in factual knowledge questions \citep[e.g.][]{mondak2004knowledge}.} Figure~\ref{fig:models} displays the coefficients of regression models with each knowledge/sophistication measure as the dependent variable.

\begin{figure}[h]
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../fig/models.pdf}
\caption{Comparing Determinants of Political Sophistication}\label{fig:models}
\end{figure}

Overall, the patterns are quite similar across different dependent variables. Knowledge and sophistication is significantly higher among respondents who are more exposed to political news media, discuss politics frequently, and are more educated. However, there are some noteworthy and interesting difference between the conventional indices and our text-based measure. Most importantly, while we observe the common gender gap using factual knowledge questions (or based on interviewer assessments), this difference disappears when looking at sophistication based on open-ended responses. Women might not score as high on political information quizzes (partly because they are less likely to guess rather express lack of knowledge), but they do not differ substantially in complexity and sophistication when they describe their political preferences. Another interesting finding is the effect of survey mode. For factual knowledge questions, we observe that respondents in online surveys score significantly higher than individuals in face-to-face interviews. This difference could be explained by the fact that individuals are able to look up responses to factual knowledge questions while taking an online survey. For the text-based measure, on the other hand, we see that individuals appear to score lower on sophistication in online surveys. Respondents in online surveys might therefore be less willing to elaborate on their attitudes.


\section{Conclusion}
% lot's of potential extensions, think about standardizing the measure to make it more comparable across contexts

Previous research in political science and public opinion has raised multiple theoretical and methodological issues related to conventional political knowledge indices. The goal of this paper was to examine an alternative measure of political sophistication based on open-ended responses in surveys. It was argued that this measure is conceptually closer to theoretical approaches that emphasize the importance of the structure and complexity of belief systems rather than focusing on factual knowledge about institutions. Overall, the findings show that conventional knowledge indices and the text-based measure share a substantial amount of variance. However, they are far from being identical and capture different aspects of sophistication. One of the most interesting findings is that using the text-based measure, we don't find evidence for a gender gap that has been commonly reported using factual knowledge scales. While further work on validation and the comparability of the measure across contexts and survey modes seems necessary, we think that measuring political sophistication based on open-ended responses has the potential to provide novel insights into the antecedents and consequences of political information.

He fundamentally believes that more than 50 percent  percent of this country are shiftless layabouts who aren't interested in working.

The stance to support small businesses is encouraging, but a disingenuous party platform. \\
