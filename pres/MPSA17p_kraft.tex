% NOTE: I want to convinvce you of two things:
% - there is meaningful variance in open-ended responses that is directly related to our conceptualization of political sophistication
% - if we use open-ended responses to measure sophistication, gender differences disappear.

% How can we leverage this variation to measure political sophistication in attitude expression:
% Luskin: Sophistication is defined based on a belief system: (1) their \textsl{size} -- i.e. the number of cognitions, (2) their \textsl{range} -- i.e. the dispersion of cognition over categories, and (3) their \textsl{constraint} -- i.e. the extent to which cognitions are interconnected in a meaningful way.``
% factual knowledge: inquiring for example about the number of times an individual can be elected President of the United States, or how the current U.S. federal budget deficit compares to the deficit in the 1990s.

  \frametitle{Conclusion}
  \begin{itemize}
\item Women might score lower than men on \emph{factual knowledge} about political institutions, but there are no differences in the \emph{sophistication} of expressed political attitudes.

\hspace{1em}
\item We observe \emph{theoretically meaningful} variation in the \emph{complexity} of verbatim open-ended responses.
%\item Text-based sophistication and conventional knowledge measures \emph{share a substantial amount of variance}, but they are far from identical.
\item Text-based sophistication is conceptually closer to the \emph{structure of belief systems} \citep[e.g.,][]{tetlock1983cognitive,luskin1987measuring}.
