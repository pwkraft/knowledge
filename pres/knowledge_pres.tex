% Thank you very much, my name is Patrick Kraft and I am a PhD Candidate at the Department for Political Science at Stony Brook University. The paper I am presenting today proposes a new measure of political sophistication based on verbatim attitude expression in open-ended survey items. Most studies that are interested in political sophistication focus on conventional factual knowledge scores as proxies. However, these measures have been criticized from theoretical and measurement perspectives. Lupia, for example, argues that the factual information asked for often has now apparent relevance to perform political tasks. The approach that I propose is naive in that it does not presuppose a set of information that is deemed necessary. Rather, it tries to quantify the complexity of individual attitude expressions related to a political task.

% OLD: I am interested in how individuals describe and justify their political attitudes, which can have important effects, especially in a social context. In my dissertation, I work a lot with open-ended responses.
% OLD: mention data source: ANES 2012, around 5000 respondents, online + f2f study
% I want to start with a little example. I am going to show you two sample responses to open-ended likes/dislikes items in the 2012 American National Election Study. Respondent A and B both described what they liked and disliked about the two major presidential candidates, Barack Obama and Mitt Romney. You know, back in the good old days when Presidential candidates were not considered completely crazy. Respondent A said the following:

% In this talk, I basically want to convinvce you of two things:
% 1) there is meaningful variance in open-ended responses that is directly related to our conceptualization of political sophistication
% 2) we can gain new insights about the nature of sophistication if we utilize open-ended responses

% So how can we leverage this variation to measure political sophistication in attitude expression:
% Luskin: Sophistication is defined based on a belief system: (1) their \textsl{size} -- i.e. the number of cognitions, (2) their \textsl{range} -- i.e. the dispersion of cognition over categories, and (3) their \textsl{constraint} -- i.e. the extent to which cognitions are interconnected in a meaningful way.``

% How can we measure sophistication based on these open-ended responses? Well, the first possibility would be to read them and code them manually. And while I can tell you that that is quite entertaining for a little while, it is of course very labor intensive, especially in large-scale surveys.

% While I do not want to spend too much time on the methodological details, I basically incorporate three characteristics of open-ended responses that I argue to be related to our understanding of political sophistication:
% 1) relative length
% 2) topic diversity: do respondents only focus on one topic, or do they reference multiple considerations
% 3) opinion diversity: the extent to which individuals are able to discuss positive and negative aspects regarding each candidate

\section{Assessing the gender gap}
% This application challenges a common finding in political science and public opinion research, namely that women know significantly less about politics than men. Some studies attribute this difference to a relative lack in resources like education, or a more general disdain for politics among women. However, others argued that the gender gap might be an artifact due to differential propensities to guess or the fact that knowledge questions do not address gender relevant knowledge. I examine the gender gap by proposing a new measure of political sophistication that focuses on how individuals describe their political attitudes and beliefs in their own words.

\section{Conclusion}
\subsection{}
\begin{frame}%[allowframebreaks]
  \frametitle{Conclusion}
  \begin{itemize}
\item We observe \emph{theoretically meaningful} variation in the \emph{complexity} of verbatim open-ended responses.
%\item Text-based sophistication and conventional knowledge measures \emph{share a substantial amount of variance}, but they are far from identical.
\item<2->  By directly examining how individuals \emph{justify their attitudes}, we can measure sophistication related to \emph{specific political tasks}.
\item<3-> Text-based sophistication is conceptually closer to the \emph{structure of belief systems} than conventional measures \citep[e.g.,][]{tetlock1983cognitive,luskin1987measuring}.

\hspace{1em}
\item<4-> Women might score lower than men on \emph{factual knowledge} about political institutions, but there are no differences in the \emph{sophistication} of expressed political attitudes.
